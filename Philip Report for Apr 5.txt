Today (April 5) I created multiple GitHub accounts, to play with file passing between them.
GitHub ended up "flagging" the accounts, deciding there was a problem.

So, I sent GitHub a few messages asking them to "unflag" the accounts.

I learned a few things:

1. GitHub has automated "Robot" detection, they don't want machines messing with their machines.

2. GitHub has a "Contact us" feature for appealing the flagging decisions.

3. GitHub communicates via the account setup e-mail.
