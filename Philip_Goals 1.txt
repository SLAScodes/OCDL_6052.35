For this class, 

  1.  I would like to write a Python program using object oriented programming.
  1.  I would like the program to use classes.


  2.  I would like to use the Ruby language.
  2.  Probably this means working through the Ruby book.

  3.  I would like to build a small program collaboratively with other people in this class.
  3.  This small project would be done using the online tools Ms. Rose is showing us (GitHub, SLACK).
