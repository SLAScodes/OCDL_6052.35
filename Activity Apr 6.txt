Yesterday I made multiple GitHub accounts, with the objective of 
trying to learn about communicating between them.

But github blocked them, so yesterday I sent a message to GitHub asking to get
my mulitiple accounts back.

Github replied that they only allow one account per user, because having mulitple
accounts may cause "unexpected results."

They unblocked one of my accounts.

So today I used the one account to run through an exercise on GitHub.
I also looked up some of the features on the Web.

I still don't feel completely comfortable on GitHub.
I can't quite articulate "why".

I think I expect it to operate just like a file directory, where each branch works as a directory,
and the fork and pull requests work essentially like copy commands.

But I think that is not quite the way GitHub works.

GitHub seems extremely powerful, but I am working on getting comfortable with it.

I plan to continue working through examples on GitHub, and generally messing around with it.

Learning GitHub was NOT my goal coming into the class, but now, getting comfortable with it 
certainly seems like a worthwile priority, even if it is not "coding" exactly.
